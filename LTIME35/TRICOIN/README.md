# [Coins and Triangle](https://www.codechef.com/LTIME35/problems/TRICOIN)

Chef belongs to a very rich family which owns many gold mines. Today, he brought N gold coins and decided to form a triangle using these coins. Isn't it strange?</br>

Chef has a unusual way of forming a triangle using gold coins, which is described as follows:</br>

He puts 1 coin in the 1st row.</br>
then puts 2 coins in the 2nd row.</br>
then puts 3 coins in the 3rd row.</br>
and so on as shown in the given figure</br>.

Chef is interested in forming a triangle with maximum possible height using at most N coins. Can you tell him the maximum possible height of the triangle?</br>

## Input
The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.</br>

The first and the only line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of gold coins Chef has.</br>

## Output
For each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the maximum possible height of the triangle that Chef can get.</br>

## Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100</br>
1 ≤ N ≤ 109</br>

## Subtasks
**Subtask 1 (48 points) :** 1 ≤ N ≤ 105</br>
**Subtask 2 (52 points) :** 1 ≤ N ≤ 109</br>

## Example
## Input
<pre>
3
3
5
7
</pre>

## Output
<pre>
2
2
3
</pre>

## Explanation
**Test 1:** Chef can't form a triangle with height > 2 as it requires atleast 6 gold coins.</br>
**Test 2:** Chef can't form a triangle with height > 2 as it requires atleast 6 gold coins.</br>
**Test 3:** Chef can't form a triangle with height > 3 as it requires atleast 10 gold coins.</br>
