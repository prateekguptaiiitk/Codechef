# [Lucky Four](https://www.codechef.com/LTIME21/problems/LUCKFOUR)

Kostya likes the number 4 much. Of course! This number has such a lot of properties, like:</br>

Four is the smallest composite number;</br>
It is also the smallest Smith number;</br>
The smallest non-cyclic group has four elements;</br>
Four is the maximal degree of the equation that can be solved in radicals;</br>
There is four-color theorem that states that any map can be colored in no more than four colors in such a way that no two adjacent regions are colored in the same color;</br>
Lagrange's four-square theorem states that every positive integer can be written as the sum of at most four square numbers;</br>
Four is the maximum number of dimensions of a real division algebra;</br>
In bases 6 and 12, 4 is a 1-automorphic number;</br>
And there are a lot more cool stuff about this number!</br>
Impressed by the power of this number, Kostya has begun to look for occurrences of four anywhere. He has a list of T integers, for each of them he wants to calculate the number of occurrences of the digit 4 in the decimal representation. He is too busy now, so please help him.</br>

## Input
The first line of input consists of a single integer T, denoting the number of integers in Kostya's list.</br>

Then, there are T lines, each of them contain a single integer from the list.</br>

## Output
Output T lines. Each of these lines should contain the number of occurences of the digit 4 in the respective integer from Kostya's list.</br>

## Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 105</br>
**(Subtask 1):** 0 ≤ Numbers from the list ≤ 9 - 33 points.</br>
**(Subtask 2):** 0 ≤ Numbers from the list ≤ 109 - 67 points.</br>

## Example

## Input:
<pre>
5
447474
228
6664
40
81
</pre>

## Output:
<pre>
4
0
1
