Chef Two and Chef Ten are playing a game with a number X. In one turn, they can multiply X by 2. The goal of the game is to make X divisible by 10.</br>

Help the Chefs find the smallest number of turns necessary to win the game (it may be possible to win in zero turns) or determine that it is impossible.</br>

## Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.</br>
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer denoting the initial value of X.</br>

## Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum required number of turns or −1 if there is no way to win the game.</br>

## Constraints
1≤T≤1000</br>
0≤X≤109</br>

## Subtasks
**Subtask #1 (100 points):** original constraints</br>
