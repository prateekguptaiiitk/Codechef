# [Sum of Palindromic Numbers](https://www.codechef.com/LTIME28/problems/SPALNUM)

A number is called palindromic if its decimal representation is a palindrome. You are given a range, described by a pair of integers L and R. Find the sum of all palindromic numbers lying in the range [L, R], inclusive of both the extrema.</br>

## Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.</br>

The first line of each test case contains a pair of space separated integers L and R denoting the range for which you are required to find the sum of the palindromic numbers.</br>

## Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the sum of all the palindromic numbers in the given range.</br>

## Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100</br>
**Subtask 1 (34 points) :** 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 103</br>
**Subtask 2 (66 points) :** 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 105</br>

## Example
## Input:
<pre>
2
1 10
123 150
</pre>

## Output:
<pre>
45
272
</pre>

## Explanation
**Example case 1.** The palindromic numbers between 1 and 10 are all numbers except the number 10. Their sum is 45.</br>

**Example case 2.** The palindromic numbers between 123 and 150 are 131 and 141 and their sum is 272.</br>
