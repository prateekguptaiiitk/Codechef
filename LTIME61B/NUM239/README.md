# [Counting Pretty Numbers](https://www.codechef.com/LTIME61B/problems/NUM239)

Vasya likes the number 239. Therefore, he considers a number pretty if its last digit is 2, 3 or 9.</br>

Vasya wants to watch the numbers between L and R (both inclusive), so he asked you to determine how many pretty numbers are in this range. Can you help him?</br>

## Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.</br>
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers L and R.</br>

## Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of pretty numbers between L and R.</br>

## Constraints
1≤T≤100</br>
1≤L≤R≤105</br>
